# 📚 Library Management System Project 📚

## Introduction
You will create a Library Management System using Python 🐍 and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in this project. Your system will mimic the functions of a basic library, allowing members to borrow and return books and enabling the library to manage its book catalog.

## 🎯 Objectives 🎯
1. **Apply Python and OOP Principles**: Utilize your knowledge in Python and object-oriented programming to build the system.
2. **Class Design**: Practice designing classes and creating objects that interact with each other.
3. **Functional System Development**: Aim to develop a fully functional Library Management System.

## 👨‍💻 Your Task 👩‍💻
Develop a system with the following classes and functionalities:

- **Book**: Should include a title, author, and status (available or borrowed).
- **Member**: Should have a name, a unique ID, and a list of borrowed books.
- **Library**: Maintains a catalog of books (Book objects) and a list of members.

### Operations
Your system should support these operations:
1. **Add a Book**: Add books to the library's catalog.
2. **Remove a Book**: Remove books from the catalog.
3. **Borrow a Book**: Allow members to borrow available books.
4. **Return a Book**: Enable members to return borrowed books.
5. **Display Books**: Show all books in the library's catalog.
6. **Display Members**: List all members of the library.

## 🏁 Submission Guidelines 🏁
Submit your project as a Python (.py) file. Ensure your code is well-commented to reflect your thought process.
