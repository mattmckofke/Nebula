# SQL Fundamentals and PostgreSQL Setup Guide

Welcome to your journey into the world of databases with SQL and PostgreSQL. This guide aims to ground you in the essentials of SQL, the standard language for managing and manipulating databases, alongside setting up PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source database system.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you'll have a foundational understanding of:

- Key SQL concepts and the architecture of relational databases.
- How to perform basic SQL operations including creating tables, inserting, selecting, updating, and deleting records.
- Installing PostgreSQL on your machine and setting up a simple database environment for your development needs.

## Introduction to SQL and Relational Databases

SQL, or Structured Query Language, is the bedrock for interacting with relational databases. It allows us to execute various operations, from data retrieval to database structure modification. Relational databases organize data into tables, which consist of rows and columns, providing a structured format for storing data.

- **Why SQL?** Its declarative nature allows focusing on the "what" rather than the "how," making it accessible yet powerful.
- **Relational Database Concepts**: Tables, Primary and Foreign Keys, and Normalization.

## Step-by-Step PostgreSQL Installation Guide

PostgreSQL stands out for its robustness, flexibility, and compliance with SQL standards. Installing PostgreSQL varies across different operating systems, but here we'll cover the basics that apply universally.

### Step 1: Download and Install PostgreSQL

- **Windows**

  1. Download the PostgreSQL installer from the [official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).
  2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

- **Unix-based Systems (Linux/MacOS)**

  1. Download the PostgreSQL installer from the [official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
  2. Follow the instructions specific to your Unix-based system for installation.

### Step 2: Add PostgreSQL to System Path

- **Windows:**

  1. After installation, add PostgreSQL to your system path:
     - Open the Start Menu, search for "Environment Variables," and select "Edit the system environment variables."
     - Click on "Environment Variables" in the System Properties window.
     - In the "System variables" section, find and select the "Path" variable, then click "Edit."
     - Add the path to your PostgreSQL bin directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\bin`).
  2. Open a new command prompt and run `psql --version` to verify the installation.

- **Unix-based Systems (Linux/MacOS):**

  1. Add PostgreSQL to your system path:
     - For Linux, add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:
       ```bash
       export PATH="/usr/local/pgsql/bin:$PATH"
       ```
     - For MacOS, add the following line to your `.zshrc` or `.bash_profile`:
       ```bash
       export PATH="/usr/local/opt/postgresql/bin:$PATH"
       ```
  2. Source your profile script:
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc for MacOS users
     ```
  3. Open a new terminal and run `psql --version` to verify the installation.

### Step 3: Start PostgreSQL Service

- **Both: (MAIN METHOD)**
  - Start the PostgreSQL service:
    ```bash
    psql -U postgres
    ```
- **Windows:**

  1. PostgreSQL should have been installed as a service and started automatically. If not, start it manually:
     - Open the Windows Services Manager by pressing `Win + R` and typing `services.msc`.
     - Find the service named `postgresql-x64-14` and start it.

- **Unix-based Systems (Linux/MacOS):**
  - Start the PostgreSQL service:
    ```bash
    sudo service postgresql start
    ```

## Basic SQL Operations

Understanding and performing basic SQL operations is crucial for any database interaction. Below are some common SQL commands you'll use frequently.

### Creating a Database

```sql
CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;
```

### Connecting to the Database

To connect to the database you just created, use the following command:

```sql
\c mydatabase
```

### Creating Tables

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(50)
);
```

### Inserting Data

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Alex', 'alex@example.com');
```

### Selecting Data

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

### Updating Records

```sql
UPDATE users SET name = 'Alexander' WHERE id = 1;
```

### Deleting Records

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

## Practical Examples and Interactive Elements

In the next section, we will go through live examples of creating a database, defining tables, and performing basic CRUD operations. This hands-on approach will help solidify your understanding and give you the confidence to work with databases.
