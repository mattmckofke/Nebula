# Assignment: Exploring Data Visualization with Matplotlib

## Objective

This assignment is designed to reinforce your understanding of how to visualize data from CSV files using Matplotlib. You will practice loading data, creating box plots, and customizing your plots to enhance their readability and presentation.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Load and Examine the Data

1. **Load the CSV File**: Use Pandas to load the `student_scores.csv` file. This file includes scores of students across different subjects.
2. **Examine the Data**: Print the first five rows of the DataFrame. Describe in a few sentences what the data represents.

### Task 2: Create Basic Box Plots

1. **Generate Box Plots**: Create a box plot for each subject to visualize the distribution of scores. Use the basic box plot code provided in the lecture.
2. **Analysis**: Write a short analysis based on the box plots. Which subject has the greatest variability in scores? Which subject has the highest median score?

### Task 3: Customize Your Box Plot

1. **Customize the Box Plot**: Improve the appearance of the box plots by adding colors to the boxes, whiskers, caps, and medians. Refer to the customization section of the lecture.
2. **Save the Plot**: Save the customized box plot to a file using `plt.savefig("customized_box_plot.png")`.

### Task 4: Reflection

1. **Reflect on Box Plots**: Discuss the advantages of using box plots in data analysis. How do they help in identifying outliers and understanding the distribution of the data?
2. **Application of Skills**: Suggest one other type of data (e.g., economic, sports, health) where box plots could be particularly useful and explain why.

## Submission Guidelines

- Complete the Python code for each task and save your script as `assignment.py`.
- Include comments in your code to explain your logic and decisions.
- Submit your script along with the generated plot image (`customized_box_plot.png`) and your written responses for the reflection task.
