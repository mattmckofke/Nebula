# Assignment: JSON Data Visualization with Histograms

## Objective

This assignment reinforces your understanding of JSON data handling and visualization using histograms in Matplotlib. You will practice loading JSON data, creating histograms, and customizing these visualizations to enhance their readability.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Load and Describe the JSON Data

1. **Load the JSON File**: Use Python to load the `student_data.json` file and convert it into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Examine and Describe the Data**: Print the first five rows of the DataFrame and describe in a few sentences what the data shows about student activities.

### Task 2: Create a Basic Histogram

1. **Generate a Histogram**: Using the data from the 'Study' column, create a histogram to visualize the distribution of study hours among students.
2. **Interpret the Histogram**: Provide a brief analysis of what the histogram shows about student study habits.

### Task 3: Customize Your Histogram

1. **Customize the Histogram**: Modify your histogram by adjusting the bin sizes and colors. Create a histogram with custom bin edges that you think better represent the data distribution.
2. **Explain Your Choices**: Describe why you chose the specific bin sizes and colors, and how these changes affect the interpretation of the data.

### Task 4: Additional Data Visualization

1. **Visualize Another Activity**: Choose another activity (Sports, Leisure, or Sleep) and create a histogram to visualize its distribution.
2. **Comparison**: Compare the distributions of the two activities you visualized. Discuss any notable differences or similarities.

## Submission Guidelines

- Complete the Python code for each task and save your script as `data_visualization_assignment.py`.
- Include comments in your code to explain your logic and decisions.
- Submit your script along with any output images or plots you generate.
